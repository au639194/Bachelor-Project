# Bachelor-Project
"Analysis script1.Rmd" is for data analysis based on the csv file. May be a little messy and most variable names have not been altered.
"Variables Listing.pdf" is for keeping track of which variable names represent which data.
"dataframe2.csv" is the raw dataset from the second import.
